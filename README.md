# radarr-health-agent

A small service that watches a Radarr instance (SABnzbd + Trakt lists), fixes the routine
breakages itself, and hands anything unusual to an LLM (via OpenCode Go) for a diagnosis that
lands in your notifications. It's the movie counterpart of sonarr-health-agent and works the same
way. It runs as a Docker container, deployed by GitHub Actions from a self-hosted runner.

## What it does each cycle

| Problem | Detection | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Trakt list auth broken | Token `expires` in the past, or list named in the `ImportListStatusCheck` health warning **and** the provider test fails | Back-date `expires` (PUT with `forceSave=true`), run `ImportListSync` for that list so Radarr renews via its stored refresh token, verify with the provider test. If the refresh token is dead, notify with the one-click re-auth path. Retries at most every `TRAKT_RETRY_HOURS`. |
| Import blocked, clean files available | `trackedDownloadState=importBlocked`; manual-import candidates have a matched movie and no rejections (e.g. "matched to movie by ID") | `ManualImport` command for those files (samples etc. left behind) |
| Import blocked, release is useless | Every candidate permanently rejected as not-an-upgrade / sample / already imported | Remove from SABnzbd + blocklist, no re-search |
| Import blocked, anything else | Unknown rejection, no files visible (path mapping) | Escalate |
| Stuck importing | `importPending`/`importing` for `IMPORT_PENDING_MINUTES` | `RefreshMonitoredDownloads` once; escalate at 3× threshold |
| Failed in SABnzbd but not processed | `failedPending` for `FAILED_PENDING_MINUTES` | Remove + blocklist + search again |
| Stalled download | `sizeleft` unchanged for `STALL_MINUTES` | Remove + blocklist + search again |
| Many stalls at once / download client health warning | ≥ `MASS_STALL_THRESHOLD` stalled, or `DownloadClient*` health issue | **No blocklisting** (SABnzbd is probably paused or out of disk); escalate |
| Other health warnings/errors | `/api/v3/health` | Notify + escalate (`HEALTH_IGNORE` filters noise) |

Queue records are grouped by `downloadId`, so a download listed more than once (a collection pack
mapped to several movies) is acted on once.

## Radarr versions

Written for **Radarr v6** (checked against 6.4.4), where `/api/v3` is the current API (`GET /api`
reports `"current": "v3"`, nothing deprecated). Radarr v4 and v5 serve the same API.

Recent Radarr versions raise an `AllowedHostsCheck` health warning while **Settings → General →
Allowed Hosts** is empty, which the agent reports like any other warning. Either fill in Allowed Hosts
(include the host in `RADARR_URL`, or the agent's requests get rejected) or add `AllowedHostsCheck` to
`HEALTH_IGNORE`.

## LLM diagnosis (OpenCode Go)

Set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` (from the [OpenCode console](https://opencode.ai/console), Go plan) to
enable. Unresolved findings go to `OPENCODE_MODEL` (default `glm-5.2`) through OpenCode Go's
OpenAI-compatible endpoint `https://opencode.ai/inference/go/openai/v1/chat/completions`, with
read-only tools: health, queue, manual-import candidates, recent logs, import lists, and root
folders / remote path mappings / download clients / disk space. Secrets are redacted before
anything is sent. The same issue set is only escalated once per `ESCALATE_COOLDOWN_HOURS`, so a
persistent warning costs one diagnosis a day, not one per cycle.

The model must be one Go serves over **Chat Completions** (e.g. `glm-5.2`, `glm-5.3`, `kimi-k3`,
`deepseek-v4-pro`, `mimo-v2.6-pro`); Responses-API and Anthropic-Messages models on Go won't
work with this client. List models: `curl https://opencode.ai/inference/go/v1/models`.

`LLM_ACTIONS=true` additionally lets the model remove/blocklist a queue item, import specific
files, or run `RefreshMonitoredDownloads` / `ImportListSync` / `CheckHealth`. Off by default.

## Deployment

Every push to `main` runs the tests. The deploy job then sends the build context (the generated
`Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`, `requirements.txt` and the package) and a rendered `agent.env` to
a Docker host. There, the root-owned `agent-deploy` builds the image and replaces the container,
and rolls back if the new one doesn't stay up. Each build pulls the newest base image and runs
`apt-get full-upgrade`, so every deployed image is fully patched. State lives in the
`radarr-agent-data` volume.

| Variable | Expected value |
|---|---|
| `AGENT_HOST` | Address of the Docker host. |
| `PRIORITY` | `high` (default) or `low`. Picks the deploying runner (`[self-hosted, proxmox]` or `[self-hosted, low-priority]`) and sets the container label `homelab.priority`. |
| `BUS_HOST_PORT` | Optional. Host port for the agent bus when several agents share a host. The container still listens on `AGENT_BUS_PORT`. |

To prepare a Docker host, run `deploy/docker-host.sh` from the dockerfile-agent repository. It
installs `agent-deploy`, creates the `deploy` user, allows only the given runners in, and turns
on unattended security upgrades. The LXC deployment below (`deploy/provision.sh`) still works as
an alternative.

### LXC deployment (alternative)

```
 GitHub ──push──▶ runner LXC (gh-runner) ──ssh deploy@──▶ agent LXC (radarr-agent) ──▶ Radarr API
                  self-hosted, labels               systemd: radarr-agent.service
                  proxmox,lan                       /opt/radarr-agent, /etc/radarr-agent/agent.env
```

Both LXCs are unprivileged Debian on the Proxmox host, using DHCP (add reservations for
their MACs).

**Every push to `main`:** tests run on a GitHub-hosted runner, then (once you've set up your own
runner and `AGENT_HOST`) the deploy job renders `agent.env` from repo variables + secrets, rsyncs
code to `deploy@AGENT_HOST:staging/`, and runs `sudo radarr-agent-install`. That root-owned
installer (the only thing `deploy` may sudo) rebuilds the venv if `requirements.txt` changed,
swaps in the new code, writes the systemd unit, restarts, and **rolls back to the previous
release** if the service isn't up after 20s. Pull requests run tests only.

### One-time provisioning

From an admin workstation with root SSH to the Proxmox host and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) logged in,
run this inside your clone of the repo:

```bash
PVE_HOST=root@<proxmox-ip> deploy/provision.sh   # STORAGE=, BRIDGE=, VLAN=, RUNNER_CTID=, AGENT_CTID= to override
```

It creates both LXCs (re-runs reuse them by hostname), installs and registers a self-hosted
runner for your repository, generates the runner's deploy key and authorises it on the agent,
pins the agent's SSH host key on the runner, and sets the `AGENT_HOST` repo variable. The target
repository is detected from the clone (`gh repo view`); set `GH_REPO=owner/name` to override.

`deploy/lxc/radarr-agent-install` is installed root-owned at bootstrap and deliberately **not**
updated by CI deploys. After changing it, re-run `deploy/provision.sh`.

### Self-hosted runners and public repositories

GitHub advises against attaching self-hosted runners to public repositories, because a pull
request from a fork could run code on your hardware. This workflow runs tests on GitHub-hosted
runners and never runs the deploy job for pull requests, but to be safe:

- Deploy from a **private** copy of this repository, or
- If you keep it public, set Settings → Actions → General → "Fork pull request workflows" to
  require approval for all outside collaborators, and never add the `self-hosted` label to a job
  that runs on `pull_request`.

## Secrets and variables (required before the first deploy)

This repository contains **no secrets**. Add them yourself under **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions** before the first deploy. The deploy job stops with a clear error if a
required value is missing. Every setting is also documented in `.env.example`.

### Secrets

| Secret | Required | Expected value |
|---|---|---|
| `RADARR_API_KEY` | **yes** | Radarr's API key: Radarr → Settings → General → Security → API Key. A 32-character hex string, e.g. `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`. |
| `NOTIFY_URLS` | recommended | One or more [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki) URLs, comma separated, e.g. `discord://<webhook_id>/<webhook_token>`, `ntfy://ntfy.sh/<topic>`, `pover://<user_key>@<app_token>`. Without it, findings only go to the agent's log. |
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY` | optional | An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/console) API key on the Go plan. Enables LLM diagnosis; leave unset to run rules only. |

### Variables

| Variable | Required | Expected value |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_HOST` | **yes** | IP or hostname of the agent LXC. `provision.sh` sets it; the deploy job is skipped until it exists. |
| `RADARR_URL` | **yes** | Radarr's base URL as reachable **from the agent LXC**, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:7878`. |
| `RADARR_PUBLIC_URL` | optional | URL you open in a browser, used for links in notifications. Defaults to `RADARR_URL`. |
| `DRY_RUN` | optional | `true` (default) logs what it would do; set `false` once you trust it. |
| `LLM_ACTIONS` | optional | `false` (default). `true` lets the model remove/blocklist queue items, import files and run safe commands. |
| `INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `STALL_MINUTES`, `MASS_STALL_THRESHOLD`, `HEALTH_IGNORE`, `OPENCODE_MODEL`, `OPENCODE_BASE_URL` | optional | Overrides; see `.env.example` for defaults. |

Changing a variable or secret takes effect on the next deploy: re-run the workflow
(Actions → test-and-deploy → Run workflow).

### Operating

```bash
docker logs -f radarr-agent                                   # live log, on the Docker host
docker exec radarr-agent cat /opt/radarr-agent/app/REVISION   # deployed commit
```

State (stall timers, cooldowns, notification dedupe) is `/var/lib/radarr-agent/state.json` in the
`radarr-agent-data` volume; deleting it just restarts the timers.

Uptime Kuma: nothing to set up here. The Proxmox janitor's monitor sync gives every agent container
a "Docker Container" monitor within one sync of its first deploy, with the same settings as the
other agents.

The container has a Docker health check (`python -m radarr_agent.health`): it turns `unhealthy` when a
check cycle is more than 15 minutes overdue (`INTERVAL_MINUTES` plus 15) or the agent bus stops
answering `/health`. `docker inspect --format '{{json .State.Health}}' radarr-agent` shows why.

## Agent bus (MCP for an assistant such as Hermes Agent)

Optional. When `AGENT_BUS_TOKEN` is set, the agent serves its tools at `http://<agent>:8765/mcp`
(Streamable HTTP MCP, bearer token) so an assistant you chat with, for example
[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) on Discord, can answer questions with live
data: `agent_status`, `agent_last_diagnosis`, `agent_run_check` and the agent's domain tools.

**Actions always need your approval.** MCP clients generally run any tool their model picks, so
destructive tools never run unapproved. `APPROVAL_MODE` picks who asks you:

- **`code`** (default, enforced by the agent): a call only queues the action and the agent sends a
  one-time 6-digit code to `APPROVAL_NOTIFY_URLS`, a channel your assistant **cannot read**. You
  give the assistant the code and it calls `confirm_action(action_id, code)`, which runs exactly
  the stored call. Codes expire in 15 minutes, work once, and three wrong codes cancel.
- **`client`** (buttons in your assistant): the Hermes plugin `homelab-approvals` (its source lives in the
  sonarr-health-agent repository, `integrations/hermes/homelab-approvals`) shows
  **Allow / Deny** buttons before every destructive agent tool, and the agent trusts that. Each
  action is announced to `APPROVAL_NOTIFY_URLS` **before** it runs (if the announcement fails, it
  doesn't run) and its result after, so you see everything that runs. Trade-off: if your assistant
  runs shell commands unsandboxed, its model could read the bus token and call the agent directly,
  bypassing the buttons; `code` mode isn't affected by that.

Without `APPROVAL_NOTIFY_URLS`, actions are refused in both modes.

One plugin serves every agent: install it from the sonarr-health-agent repository, then add this
agent's MCP server name (e.g. `radarr`) to `AGENT_BUS_SERVERS` in `~/.hermes/.env` and restart the
gateway. It gates the MCP servers named there, reads which tools are destructive from the agents'
annotations, and asks for every tool if it can't.

How long Hermes waits for an answer is `approvals.timeout` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (seconds,
default 300). Discord buttons expire sooner: `approvals.discord_prompt_timeout` is capped by Hermes
at 900. After that, reply `/approve` or `/deny` in the same channel until `approvals.timeout`
runs out. While an approval is pending, that conversation waits on it.

| Kind | Name | Expected value |
|---|---|---|
| secret | `AGENT_BUS_TOKEN` | A long random string, also given to your MCP client as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Unset disables the endpoint. |
| variable | `APPROVAL_MODE` | `code` (default) or `client` (see above) |
| secret | `APPROVAL_NOTIFY_URLS` | Apprise URL(s) for a channel the assistant can't see, e.g. a Discord webhook `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>` for a channel where the assistant's bot is denied View Channel. |
| variable | `AGENT_BUS_PORT` | optional, default `8765` |
| variable | `BOT_ALERT_URL` | optional: POST alerts to a bot endpoint instead of `NOTIFY_URLS` (falls back to `NOTIFY_URLS`) |

Example Hermes `~/.hermes/config.yaml` entry (token kept in `~/.hermes/.env`):

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  radarr:
    url: "http://192.168.1.21:8765/mcp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${AGENT_BUS_TOKEN}"
    timeout: 180
```
